# The Online Home of Nick Simson

My Jekyll starting point was [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/)'s hugely helpful [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Check out his documentation and [Smashing article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) if you are interested in starting a similar project for yourself.
