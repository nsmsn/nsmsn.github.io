        <p class="lede">The Tumbleweeds are a Honky Tonk and Western Swing band based in Albuqueque, New Mexico. I started designing for the band in 2011, after Byron Ripley commissioned a logo and a few promo items.</p>

In 2013, The Tumbleweeds recorded and released their first CD, a collection of favorite dancehall classics and signature tunes.

In early 2015 I helped Byron & Co. launch [TumbleweedsBand.com](http://tumbleweedsband.com), the band's official website. I helped the client through a content inventory and developed a front-end site prototype of key pages and content types in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The WordPress theme and implementation was finished by Whitney Ripley. The site uses the popular GigPress plugin for the calendar and is connected to the band's Facebook and BandCamp pages.
