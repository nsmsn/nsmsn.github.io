18F, the design/civic tech/digital services branch of the U.S. General Services Administration released an alpha of its web design guidelines this week. This style guide accompanies a growing set of service manuals and a few major redesigns of government services websites.

I spent a little bit of time exploring the patterns and UI components, and the new direction feels like a breath of fresh air. Other [reactions](https://www.designernews.co/stories/56622-show-dn-us-web-design-standards) I've seen from the online web design community have been [mostly positive](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/on-our-radar-special-snowflake) so far.

The 18F/US Digital Services initiative is inspired by the UK [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). Both groups apply user experiece practices and accessible design to provide 

Since the advent of responsive web design five years ago, the navel gazing tendencies of web dsigners have questioned if the responsive approach has led to sameness in web design or a lack of creativity in layouts. We have made the case that websites do not need to look the same in every browser. In the meantime, regular people have questioned why certain services [aren't available on mobile](/notify-the-enterprise/) or take forever to load, or are otherwise inaccessible.

Hopefully the Web Design Standards by 18F can provide some answers to a new set of questions.

####Should all government websites look the same?
Maybe, to a small extent.

Considerations in designing responsively also include translation, voice recognition and voice controls, screen readers and other assistive technologies. Because of this, I have slowly realized over five years that <strong>language is an equally, if not more important component of interface design than visuals</strong>.

Universality is one of the founding principles of the world wide web. worth noting that one of the founding documents in the web spec is the 
prioritization. The Americans with Disability act turned 25 this year, and the web industry is in its twenties

Technology companies are not the only people in the software business these days. Banking, health care, education, government have all been online since the early days of the web, and yet all these sectors have reputations for inefficient, non-universal, lousy user experiences. There is good work, and yes, even good design work being done in these sectors, if you look for it. I think the notoriety comes from a combination of user expectations outstripping the pace of organizational change and an erosion of trust in institutions in general.

Better content strategy, user experience, and web standards isn't the (only) answer. Still, I'd like to see the "responsive" in responsive design shift from responding to device inputs to responding to customer needs. The diversity of screens and devices is really a reflection of the diversity of people and their needs.
