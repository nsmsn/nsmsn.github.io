The awkwardly named, media-focused link sharing social network **This.** is defunct as of noon Pacific Time July 31. On that day, I exported my account as a CSV and gradually converted the spreadsheet into Markdown so I could archive the links to my blog. I also wrote down a few thoughts I had on social networks in general and This. specifically.

[Skip this introduction and see my archived "shelf"](#archive)

Along with defunct digital products like [Readmill](http://readmill.com/) and [Editorially](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/editorially-joins-vox-media/), This. was ahead of its time, but its influence will surely be felt in the near future. Their [Editorial Mission](https://perma.cc/4QG5-U9PS) and [Community Guidelines](https://perma.cc/5WJK-EF7R) are worth studying, especially if you are builing some kind of editorial product or social network.

The service was [launched as an invite only beta](http://thenextweb.com/media/2014/11/14/link-sharing-service-takes-slow-web-approach-one-link-per-day-limit/)  in November of 2014 and [opened to the public](https://blog.this.cm/introducing-this-1633dfee851d#.j2xb4jdsd) about a year later.

URLs have always been a powerful feature of the web. Twitter and Facebook eventually recognized the utility of the URL, and gave you a “card” to display an image, headline and meta description to give a link context. Facebook has encouraged native video and created Instant Articles as methods of keeping its users within the app. This. was designed to take away from the app, and to come back later for more good content. a network about sharing good content, not creating a data footprint for advertisers.

This. gave you 500 characters to explain “why this?”; A justification for someone to click on the headline and start reading, watching, listening, looking. Sometimes I wrote out a few things why I thought the article or content was important or meaningful. Sometimes the writing was so damn good I had to copy an excerpt and place it in quotations. Sometimes the content, image, or headline just spoke for itself.

Almost everyone on This. was a real person, or a real publication. At times it felt like it was journalists reading other journalists. There were no bots. There wasn’t a lot of crap content. Longform thrived on This. One day, I opened This. and everyone was reading (or at least sharing) the same thing, a [piece by Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong](https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story), written for both ProPublica and the Marshall Project.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today&#39;s <a href="https://t.co/DwApCRhAae">https://t.co/DwApCRhAae</a> homepage. Everyone&#39;s reading one thing: <a href="https://t.co/PsknPC2eMe">https://t.co/PsknPC2eMe</a> <a href="https://t.co/YJ688UIMNM">pic.twitter.com/YJ688UIMNM</a></p>&mdash; Nick Simson (@nsmsn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nsmsn/status/677527531872997376">December 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It could not be ignored, and I read and shared it too. In April of this year, [that piece was awarded a Pulitzer](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/04/18/the-marshall-project-wins-a-pulitzer-prize#.RhxViR5vg).

I did not secure an early invitation to This., but I did join on the day it was open to everyone. I did not post something everyday, but I did check the site at least a few times a week. I have a hard time with the word “community”, applied to the internet. Perhaps I should elaborate on that more in a future post. Regarding This., I will say I cared enough to submit feedback on the product, and an editor or programmer did reply promptly to each of my emails. I am not a venture capitalist, but I felt like I had a tiny stake in this startup. I did invest a small amount of my time each week into this thing. One of the myths that tech punditry perpetuates is that the digital economy is “attention-based”. I tend to think its much more complicated, but the labor of the editors and programmers of This. and the unpaid work of my fellow users is not insignificant, and should not be ignored.

*by Goldie Taylor*

Every new policer officer-involved shooting gets more and more intersectional. This time the victim was a professional mental health and human services worker, trying to protect a member of another vulnerable population.

As someone who has worked with developmentally disabled adults in the past, I'm deeply disturbed that the police officer was actually aiming at the 23 year old autistic man.

We all deserve to go about our day safely and return to our families and loved ones. We're lucky both men survived.

>Empathy, humility, compassion, conscience: These are the key ingredients missing in the pursuit of innovation... Ms. Helfand argues that innovation is now predicated less on creating and more on the undoing of the work of others.

>"In this humility-poor environment, the idea of disruption appeals as a kind of subversive provocation," she writes. "Too many designers think they are innovating when they are merely breaking and entering."

Jessica Helfand's new book sounds on point.

Diamond Reynolds' video witness, streamed to Facebook is one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. 

Her video demonstrates a truth black Americans have been trying to tell us white Americans in more shocking detail than most of us have ever seen before.

>There is strength on display in this moment, but it is strength that we should not demand of anyone, adult or child. Shame on you and this country for repeatedly doing this to black Americans.

An unbelievable record in sports: 
8 national titles. 1,098-208 in 38 seasons. Coaching the first gold medal winning US Olympic team in women's basketball. And every player coached by Pat Summitt in her 38 years at the University of Tennessee graduated. 

After being approached by Tennessee officials about coaching the men‰Ûªs team, she quipped "Why is that considered a step up?"

Pat was a real legendary figure in our own lifetime. Hers is a legacy that can never be erased.

### [Ken Burns adresses Trump, Orlando, sexual assault at Stanford's commencement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F8zCQ4YnZ8) ###

Ken Burns squarely addresses the national anxieties to the Class of 2016 on the historical day of the tragic mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. 

On Trump:

>“As a student of history, I recognize this type. He emerges everywhere and in all eras. We see nurtured in his campaign an incipient proto-fascism, a nativist anti-immigrant Know Nothing-ism, a disrespect for the judiciary, the prospect of women losing authority over their own bodies, African Americans again asked to go to the back of the line, voter suppression gleefully promoted, jingoistic saber rattling, a total lack of historical awareness, a political paranoia that, predictably, points fingers,always making the other wrong. These are all virulent strains that have at times infected us in the past. But they now loom in front of us again – all happening at once. We know from our history books that these are the diseases of ancient and now fallen empires.”

>“Edward R. Murrow would have exposed this naked emperor months ago. He is an insult to our history. Do not be deceived by his momentary 'good behavior.' It is only a spoiled, misbehaving child hoping somehow to still have dessert.”


On Orlando:

>“And do not think that the tragedy in Orlando underscores his points. It does not. We must 'disenthrall ourselves,' as Abraham Lincoln said, from the culture of violence and guns. And then 'we shall save our country.' ”


On rape:

>“Look. I am the father of four daughters. If someone tells you they’ve been sexually assaulted, take it effing seriously. And listen to them! Maybe, some day, we will make the survivor’s eloquent statement as important as Dr. King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail.”

"I wanted to be a hero" is a piss-poor excuse for chasing a UHaul van in traffic and firing a weapon out of your window at a busy intersection before fleeing the scene.

Ken Burns defends the humanities and describes how issues of race have informed almost every project he's worked on. There's a whole lot more here (Jefferson, intersectionality) but that quote above really stuck out."

The anxieties of this election year, normally turned up to 11 on 24 hour cable news are just a backdrop against Wilmore's casual delivery: a high volume of punchlines, a handful of which truly land, and some brutally honest shots.

This is worth watching for Obama's reactions (he's always seemed to enjoy himself at these) and the chilly reception in the (mostly white) audience.

To me, the 'breakup' user flow is a much more fascinating product decision than 'reactions'.

About three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents shared on social media.
