<p>Happy 2015! Its January, and by now you're already sick of reading year-end retrospective posts.</p>

2014 was a heart-wrenching year that I'm in no hurry to re-live, but for me it was also a year of incredible learning and content too good to ignore. I spent a little bit of time flicking through my Instapaper hearts and Twitter stars. What follows is a list of recommendations and endorsements&mdash;articles, videos, podcasts, and more that deserve a second reading, listen, or viewing.

My criteria for this best of list is pretty straightforwrd: (1) It has to be have a 2014 timestamp, and (2) it has to be spectacular.


###Notable Writing
* ["13 Ways Designers Screw Up Client Presentations and one weird trick you won’t believe works every time."](https://medium.com/@monteiro/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations-51aaee11e28c) by Mike Montiero, despite its spammy title, is actually a teriffic list of hard-earned lessons. Published on Medium.com

* ["The Boring Designer"](http://blog.capwatkins.com/the-boring-designer) by Cap Watkins, on his personal blog. To hell with rockstars and ninjas. I want to be boring.

John shares his personal journey through RC and U2 and dismisses those who would try to erect a border wall of geek-cred based on race, gender, class, or "being there from the start." When it comes to fandom and geekery, its a land of abundance, not scarcity.

###Required viewing
Video of the Year: [Malala Yousafzai's Nobel Peace Prize Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOqIotJrFVM&feature=youtu.be)


###Best Conference Talks
* Maciej Cegłowski: [The Internet with a Human Face](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm).

* Derek Featherstone: [CSS, Accessibility, and You](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-accessibility-and-you). Derek's talk is required viewing for every web designer and developer. There was a lot about accessibility (Microsoft's high-contrast mode) I wasn't aware of and am rethinking (and refactoring) a lot of past decision-making as a result.

* Nicole Fenton: [Interface Writing: Code for Humans](http://nicolefenton.com/interface-writing/).

* James C. Gunther: [Hummingbird for Content Strategists](http://jamescgunter.com/Hummingbird-content-strategy.html). This is a great transcript of a talk about SEO, and how to win at Google. Hint: it will also help you win at accessibility and customer service.

* Kristin Halvorson: ["Go home, Marketing.  You are drunk"](https://soundcloud.com/officialsxsw/go-home-marketing-you-are). Kristina talks real numbers about that Super Bowl Oreo tweet, shiny object sysndrome, and Peak Derp. [(Audio)](https://soundcloud.com/officialsxsw/go-home-marketing-you-are). [(Slides)](http://www.slideshare.net/khalvorson/go-home-marketing-you-are-drunk).

* Laura Hogan: [Mobile Web at Etsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG53j60ALIw). I was lucky to see this delivered in person at [Breaking Development](http://bdconf.com/events/nashville-2014/). For me, the highlight was meeting Laura afterward and getting an early pre-release copy of her [new book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033578.do)!

* Dave Olsen: [The Death of Lorem Ipsum and Pixel-Perfect Content](http://bradfrost.com/blog/link/the-death-of-lorem-ipsum-pixel-perfect-content/). This is a talk about workflow, technical stuff, content strategy, and visual design too. Dave does a great job covering a lot of ground and tying together all the aspects of making an effective website.

###Leave a comment or share your recommendations
I would love to hear from you if you find any of this useful. If you see something published this year (2015) that you think I should look at, please leave a comment below or use my [contact form](http://nicksimson.com/info/#contact).

Is January 24 too late for a year end retrospective? Yeah, probably. The focus of this blog is original writing, so I will save my 2015 endorsements for the end of this year (or more realistically, mid February 2016).
