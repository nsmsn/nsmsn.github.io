2016 is here&mdash;in fact it is nearly February. So in keeping with my tradition of posting a year-end wrap up several weeks into the calendar year, here is my annual list of links. Per usual, this is a very unscientific list, and by no means authoritative (or authoritarian). Just things published in 2015 (with one exception) that I read, watched or otherwise consumed between January 1st and December 31st that caught my eye, gave me pause or tempted me to post "THIS." in my [Twitter&nbsp;feed](https://twitter.com/nsmsn/). 

There was more of a method to the madness this year compared to last year. After publishing my [Best of 2014 list](http://nicksimson.com/Best-of-2014/) in early 2015, I started an Evernote page to post links to things I thought were compelling immediately after consuming them. I also started tracking my own consumption a little more, using apps and social networks I was already invested in using. Specifically my [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) "hearts", [Reading.am "yeps"](https://www.reading.am/nsmsn/all/yeps), and the few books I actually finished according to&nbsp; Goodreads.

<h3>Books</h3>
This was kind of a lousy year for me reading new books. Of what I did manage to pick up and/or finish, here are my&nbsp;recommendations:

[<em>Give Us the Ballot</em>](http://ari-berman.com/give-us-the-ballot/) by Ari Berman (Farrar, Straus and&nbsp;Giroux).<br/>
I started this one in December and am still reading through it. The overturning of the protections of the Voting Rights Act on its 50th anniversary is one of the most shameful things that happened in 2015. Berman's book is an engrossing modern history of the struggle for voting rights, particularly in the South, for the last 50&nbsp;years.

[An interactive, annotated <em>Bartleby, the Scrivener</em>](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/10/herman_melville_s_bartleby_the_scrivener_an_interactive_annotated_text.html), originally written in 1853 by Herman Melville, published on&nbsp;Slate.com.<br/>
I had kind of written off Slate for a while, but they do some cool, ambitious experiments, like this interactive edition of <em>Bartleby</em>, researched and footnoted by Andrew Kahn, with ten categories of footnotes. It makes for a great afternoon online reading experience, and also features an audiobook&nbsp;version.

[<em>Terms of Service</em>](http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062282460/terms-of-service) by Jacob Silverman&nbsp;(HarperCollins).<br/>
Social media is a wonderful and tiresome thing. This book explores the hidden price of constant connection and "disruptive innovation". Silverman's book had two standout chapters: one on privacy, surveillance and bulk data collection; and a probing look into new on-demand app-enabled services like Uber and Airbnb, and its hundreds of&nbsp;copycats.

[<em>The People's Platform</em>](http://us.macmillan.com/thepeoplesplatform/astrataylor) by Astra Taylor&nbsp;(Picador).<br/>
OK, so this was actually published in 2014, had I read it two years ago, it would have made the 2014 list. In a similar vein as <em>Terms of Service</em>, Taylor examines the failure of the promise of the World Wide Web and the digital age to empower artists, writers, creators, and also social movements. The power dynamic (at least in capital), is unevenly distributed in the hands of the CEOs and owner class of a select few platforms, not unlike every other sector of the economy. Damningly, the move to digital distribution has cut many of the middle class jobs and incomes from the arts, journalism, and culture&nbsp;sectors.

Haunting, heatbreaking images of Syrian refugees by NYT photojournalists [Mauricio Lima, Sergey Ponomarev](http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/on-migrant-trail-melding-words-and-images/#slideshow/100000003981822/100000003981847), and [Daniel&nbsp;Etter](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2015/08/17/world/europe/migrants-find-an-unbridled-route-to-greece/s/20150817-MIGRANTS-slide-4IDI.html).

It shouldn't have taken the massacre of 9 churchgoers to bring down the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State Capitol. The image of [activist Bree Newsome in climbing gear taking the flag down herself](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/bree-newsome-confederate-flag-history) illustrates the power of nonviolent direct action. She, of course, would be arrested and the flag would be raised again only to be lowered 10 days later, ceremoniously by the S.C.&nbsp;lawmakers.

<h3>Interviews</h3>

I didn't know about the relaunch of [The Best Show](http://thebestshow.net/) until early 2015. Only a few weeks into doing the weekly 3-hour marathon again, host Tom Scharpling experienced some major loss. I enjoyed Alex Pappademas' [interview with Tom for <em>Grantland</em>](http://grantland.com/features/the-grantland-qa-tom-scharpling/). If <em>Grantland</em> couldn't survive 2015, I'm sure glad Scharpling&nbsp;did.

Marc Maron's interviews with [Terry Gross](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_604_-_terry_gross) and [President Barack Obama](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_613_-_president_barack_obama), on his WTF&nbsp;Podcast.

I listened to a lot of Tommy Womack's music in college a decade ago. I was really glad to hear [Womack interviewed by Todd Steed](http://wuot.org/post/tommy-womack-back-edge#stream/0) as well as a few cuts, on my local public radio&nbsp;station.

If you are interested in what I'm looking at throughout this year, I occasionally share my online reading habits through [Reading.am](https://www.reading.am/nsmsn), and offline reading through [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12733451-nick). I also joined the hot new social network [This.](https://this.cm/nsmsn/follow), which only lets you share one thing per 24-hour period&mdash;quality, not&nbsp;quantity.

I'll close this out by mentioning that 2015 was a notable year for Nick the person, not just Nick the consumer. In that year I got to hold my first niece, celebrate my fifth wedding anniversary, and pay my first veterinarian bills. I served as an usher at my sister's wedding and a pallbearer for my great-grandmother's funeral. I traveled quite a bit this year for family stuff, friend stuff, art shows and a conference. Out-of-state, I drove to Alabama for the very first time, and took repeat trips to Arizona, New Mexico, New York (both the City and Upstate), North Carolina, Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Virgina. 

Production-wise, I launched the [Tumbleweeds website](http://nicksimson.com/new-tumbleweeds-website/), a website for composer and artistic director [Jason Overall](http://nicksimson.com/work/jason-overall/), and my third [Annual Report website](http://tennessee.edu/annual) for the University of Tennessee. I spent most of 2015 working on a major redesign/realign/overhaul, learning and collaborating a lot in the process, and am beginning to see this work finally in public use early this year. For the upcoming year, my goals are to not to do more things, but do things better. I'll let you know how all that&nbsp;goes.
