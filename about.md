#Designer, process junkie, and space pen user
<img class="profile" alt="Portrait of Nick Simson" src="/images/profile-2014.jpg" />
I’ve been exploring graphic design in one form or another for as long as I can remember. My formal education in design began in 2004 as soon as I discovered that there was a college major that combined photography, drawing, writing, and creating letterforms on cold-press illustration board. That was also the year I bought my first Apple computer.

Today, I work full-time for a large, mission-focused, public organization and occasionally contribute pixels, code, and CMS know-how for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. I live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Marble City</a> and am married to <a href="http://eleanoraldrich.com" title="Eleanor Aldrich">Eleanor</a>, who makes paintings.

### About this Site
This is my personal website, portfolio, and blog. Like most websites, this one is perpetually under development. You can track its progress at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nsmsn/nsmsn.github.io).

My motto lately has been &ldquo;Define, then refine&rdquo;. I ended up using Jekyll and Github Pages to teach myself something new and to build a simple site I can iterate on quickly. For those interested in digging deeper, I created a page with more <a href="/info/resources/" title="Resources">background info</a> on some of the tech and tools I’m currently using.

### Elsewhere
I'm trying to do my part to keep the personal website thing relevant and not some relic of a bygone, pre-social media age. That said, if you are interested, you can

* Chirp with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nsmsn)
