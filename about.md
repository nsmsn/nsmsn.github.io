<h2>Profile</h2>
I’ve been exploring graphic design in one form or another for as long as I can remember. My formal education in design began in 2004 as soon as I discovered that there was a college major that combined photography, drawing, writing, and creating letterforms on cold-press illustration board. That was also the year I bought my first Apple&nbsp;computer.

Today, I work full-time for a large, mission-focused, public organization and occasionally contribute pixels, code, and CMS know-how for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. I'm married to <a href="http://eleanoraldrich.com" title="Eleanor Aldrich">Eleanor</a>, who makes paintings and drew the pencil sketch on this page. We live in Knoxville with <a href="/zelda/">Zelda</a>, our&nbsp;dog.

## About this Site
This is my personal website, portfolio, and blog. Like most websites, this one is perpetually under development. You can track its progress at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nsmsn/nsmsn.github.io). I built this with Jekyll and Github Pages for fast loading and frequent iteration. For those interested in digging deeper, I created a page with more <a href="/info/resources/" title="Resources">background info</a> on some of the tech and tools I’m currently&nbsp;using.
